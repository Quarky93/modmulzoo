description: Use a tool (cargo add) instead of modifying Cargo.toml
globs: Cargo.toml

Before adding a crate include a link to the crate for me to manually verify. The link should be clickable from Cursor AI chat window. 
To add a create use `cargo add` instead of modiying Cargo.toml to add a dependency to the project.
